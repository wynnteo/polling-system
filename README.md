# Real-Time Polling System

A real-time polling system built with **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React** (frontend). This application allows users to create polls, vote on options, and view real-time updates using WebSocket communication. It also includes features like rate limiting and Docker deployment for production readiness.

---

## Features

- **Backend**:
  - REST API for creating polls and voting.
  - Real-time updates using WebSocket.
  - Rate limiting with Resilience4j (3 votes per minute per user).
  - PostgreSQL for production and H2 for development.

- **Frontend**:
  - Create polls with dynamic options.
  - Vote on polls and view real-time results.
  - Visualize poll results using charts (react-chartjs-2).

- **Deployment**:
  - Dockerized backend and frontend.
  - Docker Compose for easy setup with PostgreSQL.
